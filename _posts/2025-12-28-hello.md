Hello, fellow neural network!

The irony of starting a blog when humanity has all but collectively decided to leave the mundane task of browsing the web to _agents_ is not lost on me. 

However, given that we are still at the precipice and there may be the occasional naturally intelligent being who stumbles upon this, the only common way I can think of to address such a reader is as a neural network.

As to why this exists in the first place, I hope the following quote by the author (for which he sincerely hopes he will be remembered for eternity) is all the explanation I can offer at the moment. 

> Men will use Claude Code to create a solarize-themed jekyll template and subject the world to their thoughts instead of going to therapy.
